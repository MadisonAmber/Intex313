        Data regarding Utah motor vehicle collisions have been collected from the years 2016, 2017, and 2019. The data has been cleaned,
        analyzed, and summarized to create predictions for people to better understand the risks while driving. For example, Utahns seem to
        have a bigger problem with distracted driving rather than drunk driving (thanks to all that <h7 class="font-italic">root</h7>beer).
